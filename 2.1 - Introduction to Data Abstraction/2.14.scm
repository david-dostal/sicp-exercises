; After considerable work, Alyssa P. Hacker delivers her finished system.
; Several years later, after she has forgotten all about it, she gets a frenzied
; call from an irate user, Lem E. Tweakit. It seems that Lem has noticed that
; the formula for parallel resistors can be written in two algebraically
; equivalent ways:
; R1*R2 / (R1+R2) and 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2).
; He has written the following two programs, each of which computes the
; parallel-resistors formula differently:

(define (par1 r1 r2)
  (div-interval (mul-interval r1 r2)
                (add-interval r1 r2)))

(define (par2 r1 r2)
  (let ((one (make-interval 1 1)))
    (div-interval one
                  (add-interval (div-interval one r1)
                                (div-interval one r2)))))

; Lem complains that Alyssaâ€™s program gives different answers for the two ways
; of computing. This is a serious complaint.

; Exercise 2.14:
; ==============
; Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the behavior of the system on a
; variety of arithmetic expressions. Make some intervals A and B, and use them
; in computing the expressions A/A and A/B. You will get the most insight by
; using intervals whose width is a small percentage of the center value. Examine
; the results of the computation in center-percent form(see Ex. 2.12).

; The results are indeed different and Lem is right. Let's investigate further.
