; Exercise 1.44:
; ==============
; The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing.
; If f is a function and dx is some small number, then the smoothed version of f
; is the function whose value at a point x is the average of f (x + dx), f (x)
; and f (x +dx).
;
; Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that computes f and
; returns a procedure that computes the smoothed f.
;
; It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the
; smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the n-fold smoothed function. Show how
; to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given function using smooth
; and repeated from Exercise 1.43.

(define dx 0.00001)

(define (smooth f)
  (lambda (x)
    (average (f (- x dx)) (f x) (f (+ x dx)))))

(define (average x y z)
  (/ (+ x y z) 3))

(define (repeated-smooth f n)
  ((repeated smooth n) f))
